Program Counter: 4

The Stack
=========
--- foo
    x [5]
--- main
    (empty)

This program calls the main function which immediately calls the foo
function. After this, the value 5 is assigned to x. However, as we can see,
after x is assigned, the function foo is called again and will continue to
be called again. It will never give us an output.
