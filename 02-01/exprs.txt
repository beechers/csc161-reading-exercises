1. Int is a data type that represents an integer. int is typically the
natural the size for the machine you are on. However, short is often 16
bits while long is 32 and int is either 16 or 32 bits. Short and long are
qualifiers that can be applied to basic data types, specifically to
integers. A float is a data type that has a fractional part. A float is
typically 32 bit and has at least 6 significant digits. A double precision
floating point has an increased precision over a normal float.

2. 3.000000

#include <stdio.h>

float main() {
  float y;
  y = (2 + 5)/2;
  printf("%f\n", y);
}

It truncates the value down to 3 instead of 3.5

3. After executing the code, i=1, j=1, x=0, y=1
This is because for x, the i is increased after the code is executed, this
means that it will set x equal to 0 and then change the i afterwards.
